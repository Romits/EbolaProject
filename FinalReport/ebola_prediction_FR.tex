\begin{abstract}
The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the worst in history.
Most traditional epidemiological models are compartmental models that have a random-mixing
assumption, calculating the effective reproductive rate of an outbreak.
We survey three of these models: the classic
SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model and two extensions used in Ebola research.

Network models allow for avoiding the random-mixing
assumption inherent in compartmental models.
This is done by assigning each individual a finite set of permanent contacts.
We review generated contact network models for SARS, including an urban network, a random network, and
a scale-free network.
We then propose a worldwide network model that takes an alternate approach to modeling
the flow of people based on economic trade data and attempt to predict the future
of the Ebola outbreak.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

In this paper we explore predicting an Ebola outbreak using a worldwide network of trading countries.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:RelatedWork}

Related work by \citep{gomes2014assessing} attempts to predict the spread of Ebola
to different parts of the world based on a model that incorporates both the compartmental
approach and the use of world-wide air traffic flows.

In \citep{meyers2005network}, the authors model the spread of the 2002-2003
outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and Canada using a contact network.
A contact network model attempts to characterize every interpersonal contact that can
potentially lead to disease transmission in the community, with each person in the
community represented as a node and each contact represented as an edge between them.

\label{SubSec:SIR}

The majority of research in epidemiological theory is based on the compartmental model,
which is not a network model.
In order to simply capture the dynamics of disease spread over time, the compartmental model
employs a a population-wide random mixing assumption, meaning that each individual has a
small and equal chance of coming into contact with any other individual in the population. 
To model the progress of an epidemic in a large population, the
individuals in the population are compartmentalized according to the state of the disease. The most
widely used such model is the SIR model introduced in \citep{very_old_paper}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Susceptible (S):} Individuals who have not yet caught the disease from contact with an infectious
  individual.
\item \textbf{Infectious (I):} Individuals who have the disease. They have some probability of
  infecting susceptible people.
\item \textbf{Recovered (R):} Individuals who have experienced the full infectious period, and are
  now non-infectious and immune.
\end{itemize}

The changes among these states over time are represented by a set of differential equations.
The basic reproductive number $R_0$
is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a pool of mostly
susceptible individuals, and is an estimate of epidemic growth at the start of an outbreak if
everyone is susceptible.

\label{SubSec:SEIR}

In \citep{chowell2004basic}, the authors model the effect of Ebola outbreaks in 1995 in Congo and in
2000 in Uganda using a compartmental model similar to the SIR model. However,
a distinct feature of Ebola is that individuals exposed to the virus who become infectious do so
after a mean incubation period. In order to reflect this feature, in the SIR model is extended with
an additional ``Exposed'' compartment state. This SEIR model is summarized in
Figure \ref{fig:SEIR_model}:

\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{seir_model_fig}
\centering\caption{SEIR model}
\label{fig:SEIR_model}
\end{figure}

\label{SubSec:SEIHFR}

In \citep{legrand2007understanding}, the Ebola outbreaks in Congo in 1995 and Uganda in 2000
are also studied. However, they expand on the model from
\citep{chowell2004basic} by modeling the spreading of Ebola
in heterogeneous settings. In order to gain more insight into the epidemic dynamics,
the infectious phase is subdivided into three stages:
infection in a community setting (I), infection in a hospital setting (H), and
infection after death assuming a traditional funeral (F). The resulting model is known
as the SEIHFR model. While this model provides finer grained modeling of the behavior of Ebola,
it is also complex and the link to a network-based model becomes tenuous.
Because of this, we do not plan to use the SEIHFR model in our work.

\subsection*{\textbf{Estimating model parameters and basic reproduction number for 2014 Ebola data using a random mixing model}}

In first phase of the project, to calculate the basic reproductive number of the current Ebola
epidemic spread in different countries, we performed model fitting on the data we gathered from
\cite{cmriversdata}. We considered the SEIR model described in \cite{chowell2004basic}. The SEIR
model under consideration is a non-linear model with six parameters. The current Ebola epidemic is
still spreading and depending on the preventative measures  taken, the underlying dynamics of the
spread can change drastically any time.

We fitted our model to three countries in West Africa:
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. In addition, we performed model fitting for the West Africa region
by adding up the data from these three countries. Given the limited number of data available,
instead of fitting all six parameters to the model, we decided to fix some of the parameters based
on studies on previous Ebola epidemics. In \cite{chowell2004basic}, the incubation time of the
Ebola virus $1/k$ is found to vary between 1 and 21 days, with a mean time of 6.3 days for previous
Ebola outbreaks. For ease of data fitting, we set this parameter value to the mean value of 6.3 days.
We note that the dynamics of the current epidemic may differ from previous ones, and therefore
fixing a value based on the prior estimate may lead to some inaccuracy. To model the effect of
intervention on the spread of the epidemic, a modified transmission rate $\beta_1$ is generally used
instead of the initial transmission rate $\beta_0$ at later stages of the epidemic. The transition of
$\beta_0$ to $\beta_1$ depends on intervention time $\tau$ and decaying factor $q$. The choice of
intervention time is a very difficult problem. To this end, we looked into different sources like
Wikipedia, WHO and CDC website to learn more about the timeline of the spread. In Guinea, a
2-year-old boy died on December 2, 2013, later diagnosed as an Ebola patient. We consider this
incident as the index case for Guinea and set $t_0$ to December 2. On March 2, the Government of
Guinea informed WHO regarding the possibility of an Ebola epidemic and declared a national heath
emergency. We considered this date as the intervention date and set $\tau$ to 110. In Sierra Leone,
one person died on April 2014. In June 12, 2014 the country declared an emergency and closed its borders
with neighboring Guinea and Liberia. We consider the first date as $t_0$ and second date as the
intervention time, therefore set $\tau$ to 50. In Liberia, on March 31, 2014, there was official
confirmation of two people infected with Ebola. We set this date to $t_0$ and set $I_0$ and
$C_0$ in our model as 2. The government of Liberia shut down all schools on July 30, 2014. We
consider this date as the date of intervention in Liberia and set $\tau$ to 120.

In order to fit the non-linear SEIR model to the data, we used non-linear least squares estimation. We
use the reported data $(t_i, c_i)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ where $t_i$ denotes the $i-th$ reporting time
and $c_i$ the cumulative number of infectious cases from the beginning of the outbreak at time $t_0$ to
time $t_i$. The optimization problem contains a large number of local minima. Therefore, the choice
of initial parameter estimate is an important consideration to get the globally optimal solution. In
order to find a good initial choice of the parameters as input to the non-linear least squares
solver, we first perform a Latin hypercube sampling on the  4-dimensional parameter space.  We grid
up the hypercube with a number of grid points in each dimension.  We then choose the sample that
minimizes the least squares error as the initial input. In order to calculate the 95\% confidence
interval of the estimated parameter, we performed bootstrapping based on residual error.

\caption{SEIR model fit results for 2014 Ebola epidemic data}
\label{Fig:figurePrediction}
\end{figure}


The estimated parameters for the SEIR model of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the overall West Africa 
region is presented in the Appendix. In Figure \ref{Fig:figurePrediction}, we presented the
number of incidents at different compartments of the SEIR model, as well as the cumulative number of
infectious cases over time. Our model fit was based on the last data we collected on October 21,
2014. As of today, November 11, 2014, few additional data points are available. We also plotted
those data points on the graph. In addition to that, we extrapolated the graph up to December 31,
2014. We note that forecasting future cases may not be accurate as the underlying factors
of the epidemic are changing rapidly with the increase in safety measures.

We observe that the
prediction of the model to the cases up to November 11 is mostly on par with the observed data for
Guinea and Sierra Leone. For the Guinea epidemic, we have data for the longest range of
days as the initial case was on December 2. The estimated model, therefore, captures most of the
dynamics of the spread in Guinea in contrast to the other cases. In case of Liberia, our prediction
underestimated the observed data. Our guess is that the estimated parameters for Liberia may be
overfitting the model. While performing some exploratory analysis on the Liberia data, we observed
some discrepancies, e.g. decrease in cumulative value from the previous data points, which may
somewhat distort the model fitting parameters. For the West Africa region plot, our prediction
number is much higher than the actual data. This is understandable, as the underlying assumption
behind the SEIR model is random mixing.  Within a country without any movement restriction, this model
is somewhat appropriate. However, for the aggregated model among multiple countries, this
assumption is no longer valid due to stricter movement regulations between country borders.
Therefore, a model with a random mixing assumption will overestimate the number of infectious cases.

As an extension of the above approach, for finding parameters for the model based on the current data,
we designed and ran a simulation using an MCMC approach with input as time series data for the
various infected regions. Initial values for the various parameters were assumed as above for the
prior distribution, but a range based on the literature was used to find the most appropriate
values for the current outbreak. For example $\beta_0$  had a range of $[0,1]$,  $\beta_1$ had a range of
$[0,1]$, infection time $1/\gamma$ had a range of $[3.5,10.7]$, incubation time $1/k$ had a range of $[5,22]$,
and $\tau$ had a range of $[100,150]$. This simulation is running and we will
have results in the final report.




\subsection*{\textbf{Mapping the compartmental model to the network based model}}

It is preferable to use a model that does not assume random mixing.
One such network model we are integrating is a data set from a social networking site from
the \cite{topcoderdata}.
This undirected network has 4,846,609 nodes and 42,851,237 edges and average degree of $17.7$.
It is clearly a scale-free network because the degree distribution follows a power law after a degree of
approximately 50.
Using this data set, we calculate transmissibility and epidemic threshold.

We calculated the transmissibility $T$ of a disease which is defined as the average probability that an infectious
individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual with whom they have contact. We also calculated
the epidemic threshold $T_c$ which is the minimum transmissibility required for an outbreak to become
a large-scale epidemic.

We start with the reproductive number $R_0$ calculated using the SEIR compartmental model.
Using the relationship between the basic reproductive number
$R_0$ and the transmissibility $T$ given in \cite{meyers2005network}:

\[
R_0 = T  \dfrac{\left\langle k^2 \right\rangle}{\left\langle k \right\rangle-1}
\]

while using values $R_0=2.27$ and $k=17.7$ we find that transmissibility $T=0.1210$ for this network.

We also calculate the value of epidemic threshold $T_c$, which is defined by Meyers as:

\[
T_c =\dfrac{\left\langle k \right\rangle}{\left\langle k^2 \right\rangle - \left\langle k \right\rangle}
\]

for mean degree $\left\langle k \right\rangle$ and mean square degree
$\left\langle k^2 \right\rangle$. Our calculations show that $T_c=0.0598$ for this network.

We are using these results to predict average size of the outbreak and to compare the behavior of
a random mixing compartmental model and a network model.
We are incorporating this as a local model into our worldwide simulations.






\section{Predicting worldwide spread}
\label{sec:Worldwide}

\subsection*{\textbf{Approach}}
In order to simulate how the Ebola epidemic might spread across the world, we have assembled a
worldwide network based on international trade. Because the trade numbers are in US dollars,
we have assumed a linear relationship between exports in dollars and travelers going abroad.
This is a strong assumption, and we are considering more sophisticated mappings.
We are using this as a long-range network representing trade-based population movement and
connecting localized subnetworks with these trade-driven edges. We are developing a simulation
framework to run in discrete time steps and predict the spread of Ebola across this worldwide network.

\subsection*{\textbf{Trade network data preparation}}

The trade network dataset we are using is based on data retrieved from the web service API to the
UN Comtrade database \citep{uncomtradedata} via their web service API.
The data queried for were country-to-country SITC-1 exports from the latest data available
for each country.

Several problems with this raw dataset immediately became apparent which required working around.
Many war-torn countries such as Liberia have not reported detailed export data
to the UN in decades (Liberia last reported in 1984). As a result of this, the export totals
are incorrect for the present day. In addition, this old data reports exports to countries that
no longer exist, including East Germany and Yugoslavia. In order to make the dataset usable for
modern-day predictions, we performed the following transformations on the data (using Perl scripts):

\begin{itemize}
\item Manually remapped non-existent countries to their modern equivalents.
      In a few cases, we had to do a best-effort mapping. For example, Yugoslavia split into many
      states, so we assign exports to historical Yugoslavia to modern-day Slovakia,
      since Slovakia currently has the largest economy of the states that once comprised Yugoslavia.
\item Removed exports from states that no longer exist, preferring export data from
      modern equivalents.
\end{itemize}

We then needed to make the per-country exports sum up to the latest available export data.
The United States \cite{ciatotalexports} World Factbook contains up-to-date export totals
for most countries in the world. Using the above data set, on the (admittedly strong) assumption
that the export distribution
from country-to-country in the UN Comtrade data set has remained the same between the last year a
country has reported detailed export data and the latest totals from the CIA, we linearly renormalized
each outgoing edge in our data set so that the total sum of exports equalled the latest CIA data
for each country.
This required a manual step of mapping country names in the UN dataset to those used in
the CIA dataset.

Once we had a ``renormalized'' dataset including detailed export edges and totals matching
the latest available data, we needed to map these numbers to theoretical international travelers.
We could not find complete, or even nearly complete, publicly available data on the number of
international outgoing travelers per country. While inbound tourism numbers are available from
\cite{worldbankinboundtourism}, for the outbound tourism numbers from \cite{worldbankoutboundtourism},
many countries are missing,
especially the African nations that we care so much about from an Ebola outbreak perspective.
Some data are available from the \cite{unwtooutboundtourism}, however they appear to be behind a paywall.
Data for total air travellers are available from \cite{worldbankairpassengers},
however this total includes domestic flights and so is less useful for our purposes.

Our current approach to map outbound dollars to outbound travelers is to assume a linear relationship
between these numbers, and also to assume that the same linear relationship holds for imports to
inbound tourists to a country.
We currently use the United States as a model and use the ratio of
imports to the United States per year to the number of tourists visiting the United States per year.
Based on data from the \cite{usinboundtourists}, 69.77 million people visited the United States in 2013.
According to our renormalized data set, total imports into the United States were
\$$2.21$ trillion during the same period. Dividing imports by visitors (an admittedly
simplistic approach) gives us a scaling factor of approx. $31,665$. Therefore we have applied this
scaling factor to all edges in our international exports network, giving us some approximation of
outbound travellers from country to country based on export numbers.

\subsection*{\textbf{Supplementing the trade network}}

Using a trade network has its flaws, even discounting errors stemming from poor approximations.
For one, a trade-centric network ignores activity with low economic impact, such as
a vegetable farmer traveling to a nearby country to sell his products at the market, or someone
driving across the border to visit a family member. Relative to the economic impact of the industrial
diamond or rubber trade (exports of Liberia) for example, these potentially disease-spreading behaviors
simply are not represented equitably if at all in the model. On the other hand, economic trade data is
widely accessible and is likely to be fairly accurate,
and certainly it is safe to assume that that trade activity correlates with travel between two countries.

Due to the above drawbacks, we plan to supplement our trade network with a generated network that
captures local commute-related movement as well. One approach to generating such a network is the gravity law,
used for example to study traffic on Korean highways by \cite{jung2008gravity}. The gravity law
claims that the number of trips from point A to point B is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them.

\subsection*{\textbf{Simulation model}}

We are currently developing a simulation framework to incorporate intra-country spreading behavior
(using compartmental and network-based models) with inter-country links based on the above
worldwide network models. A related but distinct approach is the GLEaM stochastic simulation model
developed by \cite{balcan2010modeling}. Our simulation model is a stochastic, discrete time-step
model in which each time step is one day, and for each day, each infectious individual may travel
to another country with some probability related to the number of people leaving the country
via the worldwide networks on that day and the total population of the country. Within each country,
infectious individuals spread their disease with some probability related to the intra-country model
being used (compartmental or network-based).

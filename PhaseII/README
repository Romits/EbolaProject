Running phase 2 in parallel
============================================

Requirements
------------

To run the parallel scripts, you must install GNU parallel. On Ubuntu, the command is:

$ sudo apt-get install parallel

Parallel runner harness
-----------------------

The main harness script is called run_diffusion_simulation.sh

It takes the following command-line parameters:
1. t_min: minimum value of T
2. t_step: step size for values of T to run with
3. t_max: maximum value of T
4. iterations: number of simulation iterations per T value
5 and after: names of graph input files in SNAP format to run with.

Example
-------
$ ./run_diffusion_simulation.sh 0.00 0.05 0.20 10 SocialNetwork-4.8M.txt PrefAttachSynthetic-4.8M.txt

This example runs for 5 T-values (step size of 0.05): 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20
It runs 10 iterations per T-value.
It only uses one input file (so will only generate one line on the graph): network.snap.txt

Once it is done, it generates a graph in a .pdf file and prints the filename to stdout.

Nohup helper script
-------------------

There is also a little utility script called nohup_helper.sh which simply
executes whatever command you give it under nohup, put it into the background,
and outputs the data to a timestamped log file. It makes running nohup less
error prone. To use it, just prefix it to the above command.

Example usage and output:

$ ./nohup_helper.sh ./run_diffusion_simulation.sh 0.00 0.02 0.40 100 SocialNetwork-4.8M.txt PrefAttachSynthetic-4.8M.txt SmallWorldGraph-4.8M.txt GnmRandomGraph-4.8M.txt
+ LOGFILE=simulation-20141207.112323-4960.log
+ nohup ./run_diffusion_simulation.sh 0.00 0.02 0.40 100 SocialNetwork-4.8M.txt PrefAttachSynthetic-4.8M.txt SmallWorldGraph-4.8M.txt GnmRandomGraph-4.8M.txt

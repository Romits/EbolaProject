  There are no statistics available on commuting between Denmark and Norway for the year 2007.

  Some people may be counted twice, both as commuters in the own country and commuters to any of
  the other countries. This means that the total employment may be overstated if you add the
  cross-border commuters with the domestic employment.  This is because of different methods for
  determining cross-border commuters. For futher information see document under About StatNord and
  Publications.

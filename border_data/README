SOURCE DATA SET
-------------------------------------------------------------
World land borders between countries [1].

Munged via script and manual means to get a clean TSV file.

The first column is the name of the country, the 2nd column contains the names
and border lengths of each neighboring country with a land border.


SHORT-DISTANCE COMMUTE ESTIMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

We assume roughly 50% of a population of a country is employed; the rest are
children, the retired, homemakers, the unemployed, etc. Of these, we assume
based on the limited available data [2] that 0.2% of workers commute cross-border.

Based on the above assumptions, we multiply population [3] times .5 * .002
= .001, giving us the number of daily commuters, and split that across neighboring
countries based on their share of land border lengths to provide an estimate
of daily cross-border commuters per country.


LOCAL MIGRANTS OUTPUT FILE
------------------------------------------------------------

The output file is named daily_migrants_local.tsv and it has 3 columns:
Source Country, Destination Country, Daily Commuters (separated by tabs).

It is generated by the following script:

$ cat world_land_borders.tsv | ./combine.pl > daily_migrants_local.tsv


MERGING LOCAL AND REMOTE MIGRANTS
------------------------------------------------------------

We first need to take the UN Comtrade data and make it comparable to the local
data by making the columns the same and converting from annual numbers to daily
numbers:

$ cat trade-simpler-1982-2013-people.tsv | cut -f3,6,8| perl -MMath::Round -pe 's{(\d+)$}{round($1/365)}e' > daily_migrants_remote.tsv

Then we merge the two using a simple script that sums the two numbers up, does
a couple normalization chores, and outputs a unified file:

$ ./merge.pl daily_migrants_local.tsv daily_migrants_remote.tsv > daily_migrants_total.tsv


FINAL OUTPUT FILE
------------------------------------------------------------

The merged output file contains summed local and remote daily migrants. The
file is named daily_migrants_total.tsv and has the same schema as above:
Source Country, Destination Country, Daily Commuters (separated by tabs).

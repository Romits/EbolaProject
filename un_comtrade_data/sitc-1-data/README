This data is from the UN Comtrade open API at http://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api/

There are export numbers from each country in the database to other countries.

Unfortunately, for many third world or war-torn countries, detailed export data
is not available. While many countries have data available for 2013, for example
Liberia's latest detailed export data is from 1984.

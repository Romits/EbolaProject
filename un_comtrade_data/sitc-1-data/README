This data is from the UN Comtrade open API at http://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api/

There are export numbers from each country in the database to other countries.

Unfortunately, for many third world or war-torn countries, detailed export data
is not available. While many countries have data available for 2013, for example
Liberia's latest detailed export data is from 1984.

Steps taken to make this data more useful:
- Attempt to remap exports to non-existent countries to their modern versions.
- Removal of irrelevant export data from countries that don't exist.
- Renaming of countries to names matching the CIA world factbook.
- Reweighting of dollar amounts for countries that have not reported detailed
  export data in a long time in order to make it sum up to export totals from
  the CIA world factbook numbers for 2013.

Exponential growth continues unabated in Liberia. Linear growth still seen in Sierra Leone, and a worrying uptick in cases in Guinea. Nigeria and Senegal (not shown) remain stable.

Montserrado and Lofa counties are driving the epidemic in Liberia. Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is located in Montserrado County. Densely populated slums in Monrovia are thought to be major hot spots. Lofa County is located in the border region, proximate to heavily-affected regions in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Below is a [case tree plot(http://cmrivers.github.io/epipy/) of two well-described clusters: the spillover event in Dec 2013 leading to the first recognized Guinea cluster, and the Sawyer cluster that introduced Ebola into Nigeria. Case tree plots are usually built from exposure or onset dates, but only death dates are available for these cases, so death dates are shown. These tranmission trees are very speculative, and almost certainly wrong.

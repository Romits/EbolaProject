## Announcements
Datamarket has made these data available through their API [here](https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=ebola&ref=search). Their website also has interactive visualizations, and allows export to other file formats. As you browse the data on their site, please take note of possible errors, for example when cumulative counts temporarily drop. **Please be aggressive about identifying and correcting these errors through pull requests, so we can improve our data quality.** 


## Contents

* `country_timeseries.csv` contains a time series of case counts and deaths is from the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/) and [WHO situation reports](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/).
* `liberia_data/` contains .csv files of data provided by the [Liberia Ministry of Health](http://www.mohsw.gov.lr/content_display.php?sub=report2). I have noticed the data are somewhat inconsistent. Cross-check the data when analyzing.
* `sl_data/` contains .csv files of data provided by the [Sierra Leone Ministry of Health](http://health.gov.sl/?page_id=583)
* `guinea_data/` contains a mix of .csv and PDF files from the Guinea Ministry of Health. These data are not available online, so I will keep the PDFs in the repo for reference.
* `liberia_data.py` converts the liberia_data csv files into a multidimensional pandas dataframe. Pandas is a requirement for this script. Optional argument allows output to .csv.
  * You can run this script with ./liberia_data.py --help to learn more.

* `line_list.csv` is a line listing I manually compiled from media reports and published case series of case clusters. It is unverified and almost certainly contains errors. Use with extreme caution. The legrand compartment specifies with infectious compartment each case would originate from in the Legrand et al model. The source_id column is the case_id of the node from whom the case was infected.
* `Sierraleone_country.csv` and `SierraLeone_town.csv` is from the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health [website](http://health.gov.sl/?page_id=583). Data in `SierraLeone_town.csv` is cumlative confirmed cases - counts do not include suspected or probable cases. These spreadsheets will no longer be updated as of Sept 12 (newer data can be found in the sl_data/* files), but pull requests will be accepted.
